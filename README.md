# ani!Search
Browser extension for finding anime related to osu! beatmaps.  
  
Adds an extra section under the osu! beatmap info with information regarding the anime the song is from.  
This extension uses [anilist.co](https://anilist.co/) to display information such as the title, cover art, year of release, average rating and tags.  
  
Get it on the [Firefox addons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/ani-search/).  
  
Just practice for me :)
